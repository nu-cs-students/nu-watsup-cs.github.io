## Selection

Students in the Computer Science PhD program are admitted without any assigned advisor. Students have an assigned faculty mentor, but there is no obligation for them to become the advisor; first year students are not funded by faculty, but rather by The Graduate School. The idea of this arrangement is to provide students with the opportunity to freely select an advisor during their first year.

 It is currently up to first year students themselves to undergo the process of scouting out potential advisors and starting conversations with them. The Computer Science department does not have a formal rotation process for first year students, but CSPAC *highly recommends performing an informal rotation with faculty of interest in the first year*.

Concretely, if you are a first year student, we suggest that you:

1. Identify (more than one) faculty that you might be willing to work with.
2. Reach out to each one to discuss their research and if they are taking on students.
   - This will help you better understand if you want to work with them, and will make it clear from the beginning if they have the ability and willingness to take you as a student.
3. Set up a series of independent studies to start doing research with each of the advisors (perhaps one independent study per quarter).
4. Near the end of the first year, you should have an idea of which of the faculty you would work best with, and you can discuss with them about becoming your advisor(s), see below.

One good way to learn about what faculty in the department are doing and start discussions with them is to take the Introduction to Graduate Studies course offered in the fall quarter every year.

### Getting involved in research as soon as possible

Whether you undertake the suggested rotation plan or not, it is critical to get involved in publishable research as soon as possible.
This is the only way to start learning how to do research, and doing it early will help you understand what kind of research you like doing before feeling committed to some project, area, or advisor.

Concretely, one good way to get a flavor of research (with an advisor or in an area) is to start by getting involved in a project with a clear publishing goal and timeline.
In particular, when thinking about how to start working with your adviser (rotation or not), ask them to participate in a project that they are aiming to publish, rather than some kind of "pilot" or "starter" project.

## Expectations

### The role of your advisor

Your advisor(s) should (usually) mentor and train you to be an effective independent researcher.
Think of your advisor as a very knowledgeable collaborator. You are working together to do good research, and they have wisdom and experience that you can learn from.

It's not OK for an advisor to:

- Ask you to perform unpaid work for their business
- Ask you to publish false or misleading information (see RCR)
- Pressure you to work unhealthy hours, or in unhealthy conditions
- Demonstrate little or no interest in your work
- Be dismissive or abusive toward you
- Ask you to teach a class without extra compensation
- Ask you to do things that clearly go against your best interests
- Not make time to meet with you and discuss research

If your advisor is doing any of these things, **start a discussion with them about changing their behavior**. Do not be afraid to voice your concerns: while advisors typically hold the most power in mentoring relationships, students have rights too.

### Managing your advisor

It is extremely important to establish an effective relationship with your advisor that helps you learn and do good work.
Cultivating that kind of relationship requires more thought and care than most relationships that we typically have; you need to put more work in to make it happen.
This kind of work is called "managing your advisor". Here are two good starting points for learning what you need to do to manage your advisor:

- <https://greatresearch.org/2013/08/14/managing-your-advisor/>
- <https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker/managing-your-advisor>

But bear in mind that what exactly you need to do depends highly on your particular relationship with your advisor, so don’t take these as inviolable rules.

In particular, professors can have wildly different advising styles, and students’ learning styles typically vary widely too. So a key part of managing your advisor is learning what works and what doesn’t to build an effective relationship. We emphasize clear communication is a key part of developing relationships with your advisor.

## Changing your advisor

First, don't panic: you're not alone.

Students often encounter difficulties with their advisors, especially because an advising relationship is quite different from most others.
If you've tried strategies for managing your advisor and talked with them about the problems you're facing, but it doesn't seem like those problems will be resolved, the community in the department can offer support and advice.

Here is a list of things you can try to build an understanding of your situation and your options.

1. Talk to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) to learn what the rules are governing your advising relationship and possibly further resources.
   - The DGS's contact information is listed on the [department website](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/graduate/phd/) in the orange box labeled "Contact Info".
2. Reach out to a diverse set of faculty to learn about their experiences, get some perspective on your situation, and build relationships with other mentors in the university.
   - For instance, [Fabian](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) was previously DGS and still takes an active interest in the experience and well-being of students across the department.
3. You may decide that it won't work out with your advisor, in which case you can switch advisors.
   1. Meet with faculty to discuss research interests and openings for students. Consider doing independent studies with faculty that you are interested in working with; these are a great way to build connections and test the waters with different potential advisors. We recommend the same thing to all first years when selecting advisors.
   2. Discuss with other students who have switched advisors about their experience to learn what you can expect. Feel free to ask about it on the [student slack channel](nucsphd.slack.com)!
