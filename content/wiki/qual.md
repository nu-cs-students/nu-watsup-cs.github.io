There are 5 different possible qualifying exams that a CS PhD student can take:

* Theory
* Systems
* Artificial Intelligence
* Interfaces
* Computer Engineering

For specific details on each of these exams, refer to the [PhD handbook for your program]({{< ref "wiki/program_manuals" >}})

Notes and Hints:

* Typically, you want to take your exam before the end of your second year
* To schedule this, ask your advisor if you're ready to take the exam or not
* You're in charge of booking the space and scheduling your committee (as well as providing food!)
* If you don't know who you want on your committee, ask your advisor for recommendations
