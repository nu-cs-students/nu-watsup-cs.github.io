International PhD and MFA students who have not already fulfilled [The Graduate School’s English proficiency requirement](https://www.elp.northwestern.edu/english-proficiency-testing/index.html) are required to take the [Versant English Test](https://www.pearson.com/english/versant/how.html) during the first test period after they arrive on campus.  Based on their scores, certain students will be required to participate in the [Integrated Academic Skills curriculum](https://www.elp.northwestern.edu/orientation-programs/integrated-academic-skills-ias.html). Students are required to re-take the Versant test approximately every 6 months until they fulfill TGS’s English Proficiency Requirement.
