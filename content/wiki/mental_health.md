Graduate school is stressful! In a unique environment where you are balancing professional and personal relationships it is important to have access to the resources to talk about problems you encounter. Going to therapy does not mean something is wrong with you, it is an opportunity to talk confidentially with someone who wants to help you be your best self.

Please reach out to someone close to you or use this wiki to get access to the resources you need.

## Tips on Stress Management

- Set aside time to take care of your health: regular meals, going to the gym, taking a break. Having dedicated time to self care just like your grad school meetings can ensure you’re not putting yourself last.
- Set boundaries for home and school hours. Dedicate x amount of hours to work and the rest to yourself.
  - A strategy that many students find successful is to treat your PhD like a job, with the same kind of boundaries: specific working hours, specific workplace(s), times (typically weekends) to be completely offline, and so on.
- Space out work as you are approaching deadlines so that it does not become (quite so) overwhelming.
- Have a system for keeping track of what needs to be done.
  - As a student, tasks tend to pile up and come from many different places (multiple research projects, coursework, funding and grants, and much more).
  - Don’t try to keep it all in your head. Find a system of tracking and prioritizing tasks that works for you. If you’re not sure where to start, try asking fellow students for their system!
