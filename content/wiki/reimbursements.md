## General Reimbursement

Students can be reimbursed (repaid) for spending their own money on university business (e.g. purchasing food for a sponsored event, taking a visitor to dinner, travel to a conference).
In order to be reimbursed, whatever the reason, you typically need to save receipts for the purchases, obtain written approval from your advisor or whoever will cover the costs (possibly along with a "chartstring", which is like an ID for a pool of university funds).

As of May 2024, you would need to fill out this form <https://forms.office.com/r/uBRk6pF7f3>. The form and more detailed information can be found in <https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/resources/reimbursements.html> as well.
