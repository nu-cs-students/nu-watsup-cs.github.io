We received a couple of resources from [Prof. Jack Tumblin](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~jet/). He told us that they came up in a discussion with [Prof. Jennie Rogers](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/). According to him, these resources are "a gold-mine of the sort of advice I desperately needed as a grad student":

* Nick Feamster's article ["Time Management Tactics for Unstructured Work"](https://medium.com/great-research/time-management-and-productivity-tactics-for-unstructured-work-ab269a9d2cc4)
* And [Ernst’s big collection of guides](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/#all-students): (includes the ‘progress/status report’ page Jennie recommended)

## Post-COVID

During this transition to working largely from home, having less access to resources, and dealing with additional stress, new PhD challenges have arisen. We reached out to faculty to get their response on expectations for productivity during this pandemic. Below is an article made based on a response we received from [Dr. Josiah Hester](https://josiahhester.com/cv/).

He mentioned that honest and open communication is a prerequisite for anything, so he and his students have tried to keep the dialogue going and meet regularly on Zoom despite the pandemic. He affirmed that it is OK not to be productive during this time. He has seen his own mentors admit that they struggle to get work done and have been missing deadlines.

Sources of interruptions for Faculty:

* New formats for teaching and dramatically changing expectations
* Writing grants (as the new funding unknowns are real for faculty as well)
* Taking care of friends and family (mentally, emotionally, physically)

Sources of interruptions for Students:

* New class formats and responsibilities as TAs
* Slow levels of progress at times as it is very hard for some to work from home
* Loss of access to on-campus resources, laboratories, and social circles
* Taking care of friends and family (mentally, emotionally, physically)

Things he’s been trying with his students

* Level set by saying not being productive is OK since it's a freaking pandemic, and the world is changing dramatically.
* Keep communicating, showing up to a meeting and having nothing done is OK. Not showing up is worse than getting nothing done, as you don't get a chance to discuss next steps and adjustments, and you may feel guilty.
* Try to keep a set of scheduled meetings, if everyone is not showing up, then reduce the number of meetings or the duration
* Make a shared timeline / long term and short term goals, in a google doc with your advisor, and take a look at this every-time you meet, this keeps you on the same page. Don't feel guilty about moving milestones – this happens anyway, it is research after all! If you are not failing then you are not being ambitious enough.
