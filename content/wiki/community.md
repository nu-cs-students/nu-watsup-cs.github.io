One of the most important aspects of health includes social wellbeing. Here are some tips and opportunities on fostering a sense of community.

## CSSI-hosted Events

The Computer Science Social Initiative (a.k.a **CSSI**) is a student organization that plans various fun social events ranging from Arts and Crafts/Game Nights to field trips to museums, sights, and dinner in Chicago. You'll receive emails about upcoming events to RSVP and attend. CSSI events are great for meeting other CS++ PhD students and connecting with your peers.

## Lunch Club

The Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (a.k.a **CSPAC**) reserves a meeting room in Mudd twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12:00 pm) for CS++ community to eat their lunch together. Occasionally, the lunch is paid for by CSPAC, though often students bring their own lunch. Be sure to join the **[#lunch-club](https://nucsphd.slack.com/archives/C06L6LZG1BM)** channel on our CS PhD Slack workspace to get the latest info on the location and other details each week. With weather being nice, the location is sometimes changed to be outside so we can both enjoy the weather and each other's company.

## Welcome back/End of year BBQ

CSPAC/CSSI host two barbecue gatherings each year, one at the beginning and one near the end of each academic year, with vegetarian and vegan options also available. Keep an eye out for the email with info and RSVP details each year.

## Group Exercise Classes at the SPAC

The Henry Crown Sport Pavilion (a.k.a SPAC) holds daily group exercise classes, open to and free for all registered Northwestern students. You can check the schedule, room location, and classes offered [on the NU Recreation website](https://nurecreation.com/sports/groupx/schedule). Classes offered have a ton of variety, including but not limited to Yoga, Dance, Pilates, Swim (Aqua Fitness), etc. Group classes are a great way to maintain a healthy mind and body, and connect with the broader Northwestern community. No RSVP is required for the Group Exercise classes, you just drop in at the scheduled class time! (If you need to find your way in SPAC, the student employees at the front desk where they scan your Wildcard can guide you to the right location.)

## Other Student Organizations and Affinity Groups

Northwestern has many student orgs, cultural, affinity, and hobby-based groups that you can check out and attend events of (and perhaps invite friends to also join you). Additionally, [Norris University Center](https://www.northwestern.edu/norris/) provides spaces for community engagement and cultural inclusion, hosting various events across the quarter. Norris also has a [Game Room](https://www.northwestern.edu/norris/arts-recreation/game-room/using-the-game-room.html) that is free to Northwestern students, and includes an E-Sport lounge for students to play together.

## You

Reach out and invite others to enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea or lunch together once in while! Putting effort and showing initiative goes a long way. Even though we can be very busy as graduate students (and might be turned down when reaching out on occasion/have to turn down invitations), it would be particularly valuable to invest time in connecting with others and establishing a stronger sense of community. The PhD process is a considerable part of our social and professional life, and the connections we make along the way can last a lifetime.
