Courses can be great opportunities to broaden your perspective and learn about techniques from other fields that may prove useful in research and beyond.
In particular, many of the other departments at NU offer courses that might be useful to you as a CS PhD student.
Below is a list of courses offered by other departments that fellow students have recommended.

Note also that the NU academic catalog ([undergrad](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses-az/) and [graduate](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/tgs/courses-az/)) can be searched with keywords to find relevant courses across the university.

## Industrial Engineering

- [the Industrial Engineering curriculum](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/academics/courses/) offers a wide range of courses in optimization, statistics, and machine learning

## Electrical Engineering

- [COMP_ENG 368/468](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/368-468.html) (on CUDA programming) is a good exposure to a fundamentally different model of computation than most of us are taught in CS
