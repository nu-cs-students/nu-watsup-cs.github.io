Pay attention to how you are being paid, because the source of your stipend has tax implications that can become a nasty surprise during tax season.
In particular, if any portion of your stipend over the course of a year comes from scholarships or fellowships, then Northwestern by default **does not withhold any taxes**, but the stipend is **still taxable** -- even if you submitted a W4 asking them to withhold taxes!.
When you TA, however, your pay is considered "wages" and Northwestern **will** withhold taxes.
If you go a whole year (or much of one) without withholding taxes, the [IRS will fine you](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes) for having too large of a tax bill when tax season rolls around.

An easy way to tell if you're being paid by a taxable scholarship or not is to look at your pay stub (find it on [myHR](https://www.northwestern.edu/myhr/)). The pay stub will say `Graduate Wages` for things that have taxes withheld (and you will get a W-2 for these), and will say something like `Scholarship` for taxable scholarships that are not withheld.

This is described a little more vaguely by TGS here: <https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/taxes/index.html>
where they also describe that if you are being paid by a taxable scholarship, then you need to do one of two things to prevent being hit with fines when tax season rolls around:

- Pay [estimated quarterly taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes), **or**
- ask the [payroll office](https://www.northwestern.edu/hr/essentials/pay-taxes/index.html) *seperately from your W4* to withhold a specific amount from your paychecks for taxes.
