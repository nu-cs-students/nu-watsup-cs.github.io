If you want to advertise research study or collaboration opportunities, here are a couple good ways to do it.

- Reach out to <news@cs.northwestern.edu> to advertise in the weekly computer science bulletin. This is sent to the entire CS department.
- Post your ad on the [student-run department slack](nucsphd.slack.com). You could use the `#research-ads` channel, but not many people are in that channel so you will reach a very small audience. You will instead probably want to just use the `#general` channel.
