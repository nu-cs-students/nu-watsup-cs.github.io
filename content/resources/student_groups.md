Funding must not exceed:

* $15 a person if it is a meal
* $10 a person if it is a snack/coffee

## CSPAC can help advertise your group

* Send description of group, meeting time to CS PhDs (publicize to CS community)
  * Email at the beginning of every quarter there’s funding
    * At least one week before first meeting
    * CSPAC can help send to appropriate email list

## Documentation

Groups should have certain pieces of documentation:

* Groups must have mission statement
* Groups must have formal election process
* Groups must document attendance at all events and turn in to the department
  * With application for subsequent quarter’s funding

## Group make-up

* Groups are encouraged to be made up of CS PhD community members of a variety of labs/concentrations
